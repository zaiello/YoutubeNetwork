No Music/Music Videos were included Podcast Channels, 2nd channels, and main channels are listed as the same poster. 172 Videos are included 2.2 Data Collection I found each collaboration by searching “ft. [collaborator]” in the Youtube search bar. Web scraping might be an easier, faster, and more efficient way to collect data in the future. However, sometimes the collaborator is not indicated in the title or description of the video and can only be seen in the Youtube Thumbnail so a combination of webscraping and manual work may be needed. 2.3 Data File Download CSV 2.4 Coding Language Used R 2.5 Packages Used igraph networkD3 bookdown 2.6 Resources https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/new-session.html http://www.htmlwidgets.org/index.html https://r-graph-gallery.com/network "],["code.html", "Chapter 3 Code 3.1 Upload Data 3.2 Data Tidying 3.3 Plot", " Chapter 3 Code Here is the R Code I used knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) # install.packages(&quot;igraph&quot;) # install.packages(&quot;networkD3&quot;) # install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) library(igraph) library(networkD3) library(bookdown) 3.1 Upload Data # upload data collabdata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;YoutuberCollabWeb.csv&quot;, header = T) 3.2 Data Tidying # remove video title column collabdata1 &lt;- collabdata[-1] # remove collaborators 2, 3, 4 collabdata2 &lt;- collabdata1[1:2] # change row names colnames(collabdata2) &lt;- c(&#39;from&#39;, &#39;to&#39;) # subset first and third row collabdata3 &lt;- collabdata1[c(1,3)] # remove rows with no collaborator 2 collabdata3 &lt;- collabdata3[!(is.na(collabdata3$`Collaborator.2`) | collabdata3$`Collaborator.2` ==&quot;&quot;),] # change row names colnames(collabdata3) &lt;- c(&#39;from&#39;, &#39;to&#39;) # subset first and fourth row collabdata4 &lt;- collabdata1[c(1,4)] # remove rows with no collaborator 3 collabdata4 &lt;- collabdata4[!(is.na(collabdata4$`Collaborator.3`) | collabdata4$`Collaborator.3` ==&quot;&quot;),] # change row names colnames(collabdata4) &lt;- c(&#39;from&#39;, &#39;to&#39;) # subset first and fifth row collabdata5 &lt;- collabdata1[c(1,5)] # remove rows with no collaborator 4 collabdata5 &lt;- collabdata5[!(is.na(collabdata5$`Collaborator.4`) | collabdata5$`Collaborator.4` ==&quot;&quot;),] # change row names colnames(collabdata5) &lt;- c(&#39;from&#39;, &#39;to&#39;) # Combine all rows collabdata_merge &lt;- rbind(collabdata2, collabdata3, collabdata4, collabdata5) 3.3 Plot # Plot p &lt;- simpleNetwork(collabdata_merge, height=&quot;1200px&quot;, width=&quot;900px&quot;, Source = 1, # column number of source Target = 2, # column number of target linkDistance = 10, # distance between node.
